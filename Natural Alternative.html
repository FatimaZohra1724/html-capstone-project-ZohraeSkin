                🍓 Strawberries & Kiwi – Rich in Vitamin C
                        Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that brightens skin, fades dark spots, and boosts collagen.
                        
                        <p>💡 Helps with: Dullness, pigmentation, early aging.</p>
                        
                        <p>🍊 Natural source is cheaper & safer if consumed regularly or applied in DIY masks.
                        </p>

                        
                🥕 Carrots – Source of Vitamin B (especially B6) and Beta-Carotene
                        Vitamin B (like B3 – Niacinamide, and B6) helps reduce inflammation, balance oil, and soothe sensitive skin.
                        Beta-Carotene converts into Vitamin A, improving skin texture and fighting acne.
                        
                        <p>💡 Helps with: Oily skin, acne, rough texture.</p>
                        
                        <p>🧴<u> Carrot masks or juices </u>can work as gentle natural alternatives to active serums.</p>
                        
                🍊 Oranges – High in Vitamin C
                        Like strawberries, oranges are brightening, protective, and help with uneven skin tone.
                        
                        <p>💡 Use <u>orange peel</u> powder in DIY masks or fresh juice for glowing skin.</p>
                        
                🥝 Kiwi – Packed with Vitamin C + E
                        Boosts skin’s immunity, hydrates, and prevents early wrinkles.
                        
                        <p>💡 <u>Kiwi</u> is excellent in DIY hydrating masks.</p>
                        
                🥬 Spinach / Kale (Dark Leafy Greens) – Natural Source of Hyaluronic Acid Precursors
                        While they don’t contain hyaluronic acid directly, they’re rich in magnesium and amino acids that boost skin’s natural HA production.
                        
                        <p>💧 Helps with: Dry, dehydrated skin, loss of plumpness.</p>
                        
                <p> Eating greens + aloe vera juice = budget-friendly alternative to HA serum!</p>
                        
                🧡 Pumpkin – Source of Glycolic Acid (Natural AHA)
                        Contains natural fruit enzymes and alpha hydroxy acids that exfoliate, brighten, and clear pores.
                        
                        <p>💡 Helps with: Acne, dullness, clogged pores.</p>
                        
                        <p>🎃 <u>Pumpkin face masks</u> can work like gentle exfoliating serums, naturally and cheaply.</p>
                        
                🍋 Citrus Fruits (Lemons, Oranges) – Kojic Acid Alternative
                        While kojic acid is usually lab-made from fungi, citrus fruits contain citric acid which can help gently fade pigmentation.</ul>
                        
                        <p>💡 <u>DIY orange peel + honey</u> = mild lightening mask</u></p>
